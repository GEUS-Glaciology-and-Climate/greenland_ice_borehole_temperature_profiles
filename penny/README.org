Hey Ken – Here is the last of the Canadian Arctic Ice Caps. Penny! For the IceTemp database. The 1996 profile is to bedrock.

So here you are (attachments). There were two T profiles measured through Penny ice cap,
one in the 1996 borehole, one in the 1998 borehole. I distrust the 1998 profile, because
it is likely that the termistor got stuck in the borehole, as the constant Ts below 140 m
suggest (see figure in the Excel spreadsheet). The T profile in the 1996 borehole, measured
in 1997, is more trustworthy. See attached paper (JGR 2012) for borehole locations.

David Fisher deserves the credit for all these data, I did not generate them. You can use
his Univ. of Ottawa affiliation: Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University
of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada, K1N 6N5.
