* Introduction

This is a collection of all Greenland ice borehole temperature profiles we have been able to find. Secondary data, useful to use the temperature profile, is also included when available.

* Data access

+ See the GEUS Dataverse at https://doi.org/10.22008/FK2/3BVF9V

* Database format

** Inputs

Profiles are provided by archived data, shared via personal communication, tables in publications, or digitized from graphics in publications. When profiles are available only graphically in publications, we digitize these using the desktop version of =WebPlotDigitizer= citep:WPD.

Each profile is placed in a folder, where the folder has the same name as the =Borehole ID=. Within each folder the following exist:

+ README.org :: Overview of data.
+ meta.bsv :: Metadata, in bar (|) separated value format.
+ data.csv :: Temperature profile, in CSV format in =d,t= order.

Other files may exist. These include:
+ =PNG= and =tar= files, where the =PNG= file is a graphic from a publication, and the =tar= file is the =WebPlotDigitizer= archive that contains the digitization process.
+ =TXT=, =CSV=, or other files if the data was provided (online or via email) in a format that needed to be processed into the =data.csv= format described above
+ =Python= or =Bash= script files if processing was done to generate the =data.csv= file. Note - source code is often embedded in each =README.org= rather than in an external script.

** Outputs

The output of this work is in the [[./data/]] sub-folder:

+ [[./data/meta.csv]] :: Metadata for each borehole.
+ [[./data/temperature.csv]] :: Temperature profiles on a common scale, all to the depth (first column) of the deepest profile. NaN marks locations without data. -999 marks locations below bedrock (for all but the deepest profile).
+ [[./data/temperature_dnorm.csv]] :: The same data as [[./data/temperature.csv]] but the first column is normalized depth, from the ice sheet surface (0) to the bed (1).

** Metadata

Metadata for each profile includes:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results verbatim :exports results
