[W]e abandoned the 'Site' naming convention used in the original
Harrington [2015] paper in favor of a 'km from terminus/yr'... e.g.,
46km-11 = 46km from the Isunnguata Sermia terminus, site established
in 2011 (see figure 2 [ed: Wright (2016)]). If the hole was drilled in
2011 for example, a particular dataset may have been collected in any
subsequent year since the instrumentation typically runs for up to a
few years. Site 33 km was established with several boreholes in 2014,
but we returned and drilled additional holes at this site in 2015
and 2016.

Harrington’s S5 is the 46km site.
